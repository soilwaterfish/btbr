# btbaseline
Scripts and workflows for Bull Trout Baseline model development. The goal is to eventually have this in a *data pipeline* but for now it's a start.

## Folder Structure  

**R**  

This folder is the slowly growing process/development of scripting using the R programming language. Overtime this will be cleaned up and tested (unit testing).  

* `clean.R` - This script _cleans_ and preps the data coming in (2017 baseline, PIBO, GRAIP-Lite, etc).  

* `exploring-eda.R` - This is meant to be a scratch pad for development (graphing, mapping, etc) and exploring data.  

* `feature-selection.R` - Using techniques for feature selection related to `ml-prediction.R`.  

* `local_pops.R` - Future file where we'll explore local populations.  

* `utils.R` - Utility functions to run in other scripts.  

**data**  

This is where the most up-to-date data (csv, spatial, models, etc) will reside. 

* `bt_baseline.gpkg` - This is a geopackage (think ESRI gdb but free and open-source!) that will house other spatial data, e.g. layers = `bt_baseline_with_graip_lite`, `pibo_all_together`, `WCATT_HUCs_GL_Data_USC_Units_R01`.  

```{r, eval = F}
library(sf)
st_layers('data/bt_baseline.gpkg')
```

* `bt_baseline_2017.csv` - This is collated from all the 2017 post-fire baseline model updates. This has the HUC12's that were used to join with the `WCATT_HUCs_GL_Data_USC_Units_R01` HUC12's.  

* `bt_baseline_with_graip_lite.csv` - This combines the 2017 post-fire model run and joins with the `WCATT_HUCs_GL_Data_USC_Units_R01` data. Mostly to deal with roads and sediment potential.  

* `pibo_data.xlsx` - This is the PIBO spreadsheet downloaded from [here](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r4/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=FSEPRD1089819). From the site,  

"*PIBO Monitoring Program Tabular Data - this link leads to an Excel workbook with multiple tabs that contain data for stream habitat, aquatic macroinvertebrates, stream temperature, riparian vegetation, riparian weeds, and implementation monitoring. In addition, a metadata worksheet is provided for each dataset and defines the column headings and units of measure. To find data for a particular forest or BLM field office, use the drop-down toggle in the first row of the 'Region', 'Forest', or 'District' columns to filter out unneeded information. State BLM units are identified under the 'Region' column, while BLM field offices are identified under the 'Forest' column.*"  

* `pibo_all_together.csv` - This combines the `pibo_data.xlsx` stream habitat, aquatic macroinvertebrates, stream temperature sheets as well as fixed effects from [USGS Continuous Parameter Grids (CPGs)](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a789b70e4b00f54eb1e836f).

* `WCATT_Attribute_Descriptions_GL_Data` - This is the metadata associated with the [R1 GRAIP-Lite model run](https://www.fs.usda.gov/GRAIP/GRAIP_Lite/model-runs-wcc-assessments.shtml). Use this to cross reference variables in `bt_baseline_with_graip_lite.csv` and `bt_baseline.gpkg/bt_baseline_with_graip_lite`.  

## inst  

This is meant for arbitrary additional files that you want include (graphs, maps, docs, etc).

* `exploration` - This folder is meant to be sort of a scratch pad for development or a place to work on files that don't quite fit into the other folder structure.
