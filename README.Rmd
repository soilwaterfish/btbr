<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-brightgreen.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable)
<!-- badges: end -->


The goal of {btbr} is to provide a reproducible package, model pipeline and documentation for the Western Montana Bull Trout Baseline (BTB) model.

<h2 style="color:red;">Attention!</h2> 

**Please read disclaimer and understand that this is in heavy development. Thank you!**  

## Installation  

You can install the development version of btbr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("soilwaterfish/btbr")
```

The package has some functionality beyond the BTB but is mostly for reproducing in a data pipeline using the  [{targets}](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) framework. The data pipeline provides reproducible workflows while in combination with the {btbr} package to generate a Bayesian Network model output.  

* You can see the {targets} style pipeline in the `_targets.R` script.
